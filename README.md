# Lighthouse Labs | Technical Interview Preparation Breakout

Keep in-mind in a TI:
* White-board, you won't have access to Google/code-editor...
  * You hit a wall and aren't sure how to proceed.
    * Be ready to verbalize how you would come to an answer.
* Verbalize everything you're doing
* Quiz each other (flash-cards)
  * In your own words... what is a variable?
    * A named container for a value in our program.
* TIs are communication - be able to communicate!
* Ask questions!
  * Think about input... (can we always expect it to be the correct format?)
  * Think about output... (are we writing to a file? returning? console.log?)
  * Processing
    * Break the problem into tiny steps
    * Pseudo-code
