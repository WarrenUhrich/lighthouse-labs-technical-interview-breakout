Keep in-mind in a TI:
* White-board, you won't have access to Google/code-editor...
  * You hit a wall and aren't sure how to proceed.
    * Be ready to verbalize how you would come to an answer.
* Verbalize everything you're doing
* Quiz each other (flash-cards)
  * In your own words... what is a variable?
    * A named container for a value in our program.
* TIs are communication - be able to communicate!
* Ask questions!
  * Think about input... (can we always expect it to be the correct format?)
  * Think about output... (are we writing to a file? returning? console.log?)
  * Processing
    * Break the problem into tiny steps
    * Pseudo-code
  
What is the time complexity of your solution?
* **Constant Time: O(1)** - The algorithm's execution time is constant and does not depend on the input size.
* **Linear Time: O(n)** - The algorithm's execution time increases linearly with the size of the input.
* **Exponential Time: O(2^n)** - The algorithm's execution time doubles with each addition to the input size.
* **Logarithmic Time: O(log n)** - The algorithm's execution time increases logarithmically with the size of the input, which means the time taken grows slowly as the input size increases.

Big things to practice:
* Getting familiar with your dictionary
  * What is a variable? var, const, let
  * What is a function? parameter, argument, return
  * What is JavaScript? programming language, interpretor, compiled
  * What is NodeJS? runtime
* String manipulation
* Array manipulation
* Object manipulation
